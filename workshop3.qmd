•	Keeping detailed and accurate records


Introduction

Transposon mutagenesis is a very commonly used technique in microbiology and in the biological sciences more generally. A key skill for a biomedical researcher, therefore, is to be able to analyse and interpret the results from these experiments. In this workshop, you will look at the sequences obtained from a plasmid rescue experiment performed to determine the site of a transposon insertion. You will determine the disrupted gene/sequence, then predict the potential effect(s) that this transposon insertion might have in the context of your experiment.

Protocol W3: Analyse transposon insertion sites.

1.	You have been provided with a set of data with the sequencing results for your Tn5 insertions (available on MyPlace). 
2.	Use EcoCyc or another sequence database to determine the site of the Tn5 insertions. 
3.	Compare the result obtained in (2) with your data from last week: does the Tn5 insertion site (determined by arbitrary PCR and sequencing) agree with the mapping you did using interrupted mating? What might explain any differences?



Form a hypothesis: why are these mutant strains resistant to the antibiotic?
1.	Record the gene(s) disrupted by your Tn5 insertion (identified in Task 4B).
2.	Use EcoCyc, PubMed, or other tools, to research the disrupted genes. 
3.	Why do you think the disruption of these genes gives rise to antibiotic resistance? Based on your data, what do you think is the mode of action of the antibiotic?

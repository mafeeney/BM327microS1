## Antibiotic Susceptibility - Introduction {#sec-intro4}

Antibiotics are compounds that inhibit or kill bacteria, and they act through a range of molecular mechanisms. Major classes target essential cellular processes, including cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, and metabolic pathways. However, the effectiveness of any given antibiotic can vary markedly between bacterial species due to differences in cell envelope structure (e.g. the outer membrane barrier in Gram-negative bacteria), efflux pump systems, target site variants, and the presence or absence of specific resistance genes. Even within a single species, strains may differ in susceptibility due to acquisition of plasmid-borne resistance genes or chromosomal mutations.

Several experimental approaches are used to quantify bacterial susceptibility. 

* The **minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)** is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevents visible growth after incubation, typically determined using liquid (broth) cultures containing different antibiotic concentrations. 

* The **minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)** goes further to determine the lowest concentration capable of killing the bacteria. After MIC testing, aliquots from non-growing cultures are plated onto antibiotic-free media, and the lowest concentration that kills ≥99.9% of the initial inoculum is recorded as the MBC. While MIC measures growth inhibition, MBC assesses bactericidal activity, so the two values can differ significantly for bacteriostatic versus bactericidal drugs. 

* The **Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion assay** is a qualitative or semi-quantitative method in which antibiotic-impregnated disks are placed on agar lawns, and the diameter of the growth inhibition zone is measured after incubation. Although disk diffusion does not yield exact concentrations, standardized interpretive breakpoints allow clinicians to categorize isolates as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant.

Experimental conditions can strongly affect the outcome of these assays. Media composition, pH, aeration, and inoculum density can influence antibiotic activity and bacterial physiology, so strict adherence to standardized protocols is essential. Some antibiotics are inactivated by specific media components, while growth conditions (e.g., stationary phase growth) can affect bacterial susceptibility by global physiological and gene expression changes.

While classical phenotypic assays remain the gold standard, new approaches such as whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and proteomics are increasingly being developed to identify resistance determinants and attempt to predict resistance phenotypes.

# Schedule of experimental tasks

Because of the nature of microbiology (cultures require incubation and take time to grow), many of your experiments will take place across more than one laboratory session, as detailed in the following schedule (@fig-schedule). It is therefore essential that you keep careful track of all experimental tasks: e.g., carefully labelling your cultures and taking care to read all the relevant sections of the lab manual.

# Preparing for each lab session

::: {.todo title="To prepare for each lab"}

Before attending each of the practical labs, you should ensure that you have read and understood:

* The introductory sections covering [Good Lab Practice](./0goodlab.qmd) and [Aseptic Technique](./0aseptic.qmd); and (where relevant), those covering [Enumerating Microbes](./0counting.qmd) and [Microscopy](./0microscope.qmd)

* The introductory sections covering the theory underpinning each experiment

* The protocols we will be using in that lab (you do not need to print these out - we will provide you with a handout)

* You also must ensure that you have read and signed the safety forms, or you will not be admitted to the lab.

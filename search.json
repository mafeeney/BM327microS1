    "text": "Introduction to the BM327 Microbiology Semester 1 Lab Manual\nThis laboratory manual contains key information about each of the five practical laboratory sessions delivered as part of BM327 microbiology semester 1.\n\nHow to use this manual\nYou can navigate through this manual using the sidebar on the left, or by flipping through the pages (forward/reverse arrows at the bottom of each page.\nThe introductory section is a general section containing helpful information on good laboratory technique, working with microorganisms safely and aseptically, etc. - it also contains general information about the module, including the assessment. You should read through this section before the first lab and refer back to it when needed to refresh your memory.\nEach of the experiment sections 1-5 contain a brief explanation of the theory underpinning the experiments we will do in the practical labs, the protocols that will be used for that experiment, and an explanation of any data analysis tasks that need to be performed after the lab sessions. Links to the protocols (handouts) for each experiment are provided, but please note that you do not need to print these out - they will be provided for you in the laboratories.\n\n\nHow to prepare for each lab session\nYou should read through the relevant theory/introductory material before coming to each practical lab session, and make sure you understand it. In some instances you may wish to review the material covered in BM330 before the lab as well (or review the underpinning microbiology theory in an introductory microbiology textbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTips for success\n\n\n\n\nYou will also find callout boxes (such as this one) throughout this lab manual with Tips, Important notes, Discussion Questions, To Do Lists, etc. These are intended to help you prepare for each lab (and for the assessment), so you should make sure to read through all the material.\nAs Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” It is really important that you come prepared to each lab! A little bit of time spent reading through the material and performing any necessary tasks or calculations will really pay off.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to deal with any problems, questions, or concerns\nIf you have any problems or questions, please feel free to speak with Dr. Feeney during the lab sessions or by e-mail.\nIf you are going to miss a lab session (for whatever reason), you should e-mail Dr. Feeney and also log your absence with the university using the Pegasus Personal Circumstances tool. More details can be found in your student handbook.\nIf you notice any errors (including typos, broken links, etc.) in this lab manual, please notify Dr Feeney, either by e-mail or by raising an issue on this lab manual’s github page.",

    "text": "1.1 Microbiology Laboratories Competency Skills\nThe aim of this block of laboratory sessions is to introduce students to fundamental molecular biology and microbiology methods, such as UV mutagenesis, plasmid transfer, antibiotic assays and microscopy.\nWithin the block of five three-hour laboratory sessions, there are five distinct experimental elements. Each experimental element is linked to the others as part of an overall research project. Most of the experimental elements will take place over the course of several different laboratory sections (because of the need to incubate plates and allow microbes to grow). There are also three workshops (“CAL labs”) to supplement your learning – details of these will be made available on MyPlace.\nGraduate recruiters look for specific job skills and competencies. Competencies are action-oriented statements of the knowledge, skills, and abilities people need to do their work successfully. They are observable and measurable. These are what you need to do the job and work in their organisation. Some are straightforward and required in many different career: communication, teamwork and problem solving are just a few. You need to show employers you have mastered essential skills such as writing, reading, numeracy, presentation, organisation and the ability to work under pressure. Graduates who demonstrate their analytical thinking during a job interview or assessment centre will stand out from other candidates. Other skills such as those gained in the laboratory are more specific and aligned to particular types of jobs e.g. ability to do a PCR.\nYou will be assessed for your competency in the following:\nLab 1\nLab 2\nLab 3\nLab 4\nLab 5",

    "section": "6.1 Keeping a Laboratory Notebook",
    "text": "6.1 Keeping a Laboratory Notebook\nIt is essential to keep an accurate record of experiments, with details of every experiment performed, the data collected, and the data analysis that was performed. It is just as important to keep a lab notebook for experiments performed in silico as it is for experiments performed at the lab bench.\nYou should be able to come back to your notebook six months later, read your notes, and be able to recreate the experiment/understand the analyses that you performed. Human memory is fallible and it is important to keep clear, accurate records.\nMoreover, an appropriately kept lab notebook is a legal document, important for protecting your intellectual property. You should therefore be in the habit of keeping your lab notebook up to date and accurate.\n\n6.1.1 Some guidelines for keeping a good lab notebook:\n\nYour notebook may be kept in the form of a physical notebook (kept on paper) or an electronic notebook. The former should be written in clearly and legibly, using indelible ink. The latter should be saved often, with backup copies stored securely.\nInclude the date for each entry.\nEach experiment should include a title, a hypothesis or aim, a brief description of the background, protocols and details of any reagents/equipment used, observations, and any data or statistical analysis that was performed.\nAny protocols or methods should be described in enough detail that a colleague (or you in six months’ time!) can repeat the same experiment, starting from the same dataset/materials, and reach the same results.\nAny mistakes should be crossed out and explained (not erased).\nAll data should always be recorded in your lab notebook (even “failed” experiments or “outliers”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipElectronic Lab Notebooks\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasingly, researchers are using electronic lab notebooks instead of paper ones - these are more impervious to physical destruction (e.g., chemical spills, lab fires) and often more convenient (more easily legible, searchable, etc.) However, care must be taken to ensure that the data stored in an electronic lab notebook is secure and backed up.\nThere are many options for lab notebooks. One popular and widely used electronic lab notebook is Benchling.\n\nYou can join Benchling by creating an account at http://benchling.com/signup\nFor help with Benchling, including training kits and best practice guides, please see https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Good Labelling Technique\nIt is essential that all tubes and plates be clearly and legibly labelled. You will often be working with these over a period of several weeks, and you will be unable to interpret/analyse the results from a previous week’s experiments if you have not labelled your samples correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Label around the rim of the Petri plate - not across the centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Label the bottom of the Petri plate, not the lid\n\n\n\nSome general guidelines for good labeling practice:\n\nInclude your initials and the date of the experiment (if directed by your instructors, also include your bench number).\nIf working with microorganisms, always include the species name (abbreviations, e.g. E. coli are fine).\nIf labeling Petri plates, label around the outside rim of the plate (do not obscure the plate as it will make it hard to count colonies!), as shown in Figure 6.1. You should also be sure to label the bottom of the plate (Figure 6.2). The bottom and lid may become separated, so labeling the lid is a bad idea!\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Other tips for good lab practice\n\nRead through each protocol thoroughly before beginning an experiment. Label all tubes and prepare any reagents needed before you begin. Stay organised and keep your space clean.\nTurn off your Bunsen burner (or set it to a visible orange flame) if you are not working aseptically.\nNever walk away from your bench and leave a lit Bunsen burner unattended.\nNever wear gloves when working with a Bunsen burner.\nPipet as accurately as possible:\n\nUse the correct pipet for the volume you intend to pipet and make sure it is set correctly (if uncertain, ask a demonstrator or member of staff)\nPipet down to the first stop when drawing up liquid into the pipet; pipet down to the second stop when expelling liquid.\nAvoid bubbles when pipetting.\nOnly insert the very tip of the pipet into the liquid when pipetting particularly viscous mixtures (e.g., polymerase or enzyme stocks).",

    "text": "6.1 Aseptic Technique\nIt is essential that you work aseptically when working in a microbiology lab. Microbes are ubiquitous in the environment (including in the air, and on your skin). Therefore, you must work aseptically so that your experiment contains only the organism(s) you are working with, and not unwanted contaminants!\nMost of the materials you will be working with (pipet tips, microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) tubes, culture media, etc. will have been sterilised for you by autoclaving: the autoclave sterilises these items by subjecting them to pressurised steam (121°C, 15 p.s.i.).\nOne of the cornerstone principles of aseptic technique is that any objects, even those that have previously been sterile, can no longer be considered sterile if they come into contact with non-sterile objects. Be careful not to allow your pipet tips to come into contact with any non-sterile surfaces (i.e., your bench top, fingers, the lids or outsides of bottles).",

    "text": "TipAutoclaved items\n\n\n\nYou will be able to recognise that items such as tips or Eppendorf tubes have been autoclaved based on the use of autoclave tape on the containers for these items. Autoclave tape changes colour when subjected to high heat and pressure. It is essential that you use these sterilised items: do not take unsterilised pipet tips or microcentrifuge tubes from the shelves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: The use of autoclave tape to show that the contents of a container have been sterilised (compared to unautoclaved tape, on the right). Image credit: Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTop Tip for Good Aseptic Technique\n\n\n\nYou should use good aseptic technique when working with all containers (including tip boxes, Eppendorf boxes, bottles of media, etc.), to prevent the contents from becoming contaminated.\nContainers should be opened for the minimum amount of time possible (the longer they are open, the greater the chance of contamination!) Close them promptly when you have removed the tip/sample.\nTip boxes should not be left open. If you leave the box open, microbes present in the air can easily contaminate the tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: A box of pipet tips that are no longer sterile. Image credit: Starlab\n\n\n\nYou should therefore always: 1. Open tip box –&gt; 2. Take pipet tip –&gt; 3. Close tip box –&gt; 4. Use pipet tip\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Working with a Bunsen Burner\nIn order to keep your work sterile and free from contamination that could interfere with your experiments, you should work near a Bunsen burner set to a blue flame (Figure 6.3). The Bunsen creates an updraft of air, helping to maintain a “clean” zone around it. Having the Bunsen burner lit, but working several meters away from this clean zone, is ineffective and will likely result in contamination of your experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: A Bunsen burner set to a blue flame. Image credit: Encyclopedia Britannica\n\n\n\nWhen working with a Bunsen burner, however, it is essential that you follow the following safety guidelines, for the safety of yourself and those working near you:\n\nTurn off your Bunsen burner (or set it to a visible orange flame) if you are not actively using it.\nNever walk away from your bench and leave a lit Bunsen burner unattended.\nNever wear gloves when working with a Bunsen burner.\n\n\n6.1.1.1 Using a platinum inoculating loop\nIn some cases you will need to use a platinum inoculating loop, e.g. to streak bacteria for single colonies on a new Petri plate.\nYou must make sure to sterilise your inoculating loop by flaming it (placing the platinum wire in the flame of your Bunsen burner to sterilise it). You should flame your loop both before touching it to a sample (this prevents the transfer of contaminants into your sample) and before putting it down when you have finished using it (so that you do not transfer microbes to the lab bench/other surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAn inoculating loop that has just been flamed is extremely hot - you should never allow a hot loop to touch your skin. You should also avoid touching a hot loop directly to your samples, as the heat will kill the microbes you are working with.\n\n\nThe procedure for flaming an inoculating loop is:\n\nPlace the loop in the flame of the Bunsen burner at an angle, so that the length of the loop lies along the surface between the inner and outer cones in the flame (the hottest part of the flame).\nHold the loop in the flame until the entirety of the loop turns cherry-red. It is not necessary to hold the loop there any longer than that: you are not trying to melt the metal!\nRemove the loop from the flame and allow it to cool, either by holding it in the air for several seconds (in the aseptic working zone near the Bunsen burner), or by touching it to a sterile surface (i.e. the inside of a culture tube or the agar in an uninoculated Petri dish.)\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Top tips for working with good aseptic technique:\n\nWork near a Bunsen burner set to a blue flame (Many students end up working miles away from their Bunsen, which is not very helpful.)\nOpen all containers (including tip boxes, Eppendorf boxes, bottles of media, etc.) for the minimum amount of time possible (the longer they are open, the greater the chance of contamination!) Close them promptly when you have removed the tip/sample. Tip boxes should not be left open.\nBe careful not to allow your pipet tips to come into contact with any non-sterile surfaces (i.e., your bench top, fingers, the lids or outsides of bottles).",

    "text": "ImportantSafety tip for working with microscopes\n\n\n\nPlease note that you should not wear gloves while working with a microscope: you do not want to inadvertently transfer staining reagents (or other chemicals) onto it.\n\n\n\n\nRaise the stage using the coarse focusing knob so that the slide is about 5 mm away from the objective.\nBring the slide into focus as best you can, first using the coarse focusing knob and then the fine focusing knob. You will be slowly lowering the stage so as to increase the distance between the slide and objective.\nOnce you have focussed as best you can using this objective, you should move on to the next highest power objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFinding the focal plane\n\n\n\nOften the plane of focus is extremely narrow, so that small, faint objects like stained bacteria may be easily missed as the focus passes through the plane.\nThus, a good technique is to constantly move the focus up and down while also slowly moving the slide up/down or left/right on the stage. In this way, objects that flash in and out of focus tend to be more easily noticed by the eye.\n\n\n\n\nAdjust the “interocular separation” of the eyepieces so that they are comfortably aligned with your eyes.\nAdjust the lamp voltage at any time when using a microscope in order to get a comfortable level of light.\n\n\n7.1.1 Use of oil with the microscope:\n\nThe 100x objective is designed to be used with oil (it will have “oil” explicitly written on it), whereas the other objectives are not.\nNever use oil with any objective other than the 100x. Once you have added oil to your sample, never return to using a smaller magnification objective!\nOnly a very small amount of oil is needed, only add a tiny drop. Don’t flood the slide!\nWhen you have found your focus and optimised set-up with the 40x objective, swing the objectives half-way between the 40x and 100x. DO NOT move the stage or change the focus as you do this! Then gently add a very small drop of oil onto the spot of light you can see in your sample. Gently swing the 100x objective into place.\nYou will most likely have to adjust the focus a little, but only use the fine adjustment at this stage. Ask for help if you have trouble finding the focus. Under no circumstances go back to the 40x, as it does not tolerate getting in contact to the immersion oil.\nResidual oil will cling to the 100X objective after use, so make sure you clean it off with a lens tissue (specifically designed for this purpose) before putting the objective away. DO NOT use any other tissue to clean the lens.",

    "text": "It is often necessary or desirable to work backwards from the number of colonies on a plate, in order to work out the number of viable microbes that were present in the original (undiluted) sample. (Note that any microbes present in the sample that were dead, or viable-but-not-culturable, will not give rise to colonies on the plate - so you are enumerating the number of viable microbes, not the number of cells.)\nWe calculate and express the number of viable microbes in the original sample in colony forming units (cfu) - usually in cfu/mL.\nFor example, if you performed a decimal serial dilution, plated 0.1 mL of the 10-4 dilution, and counted 173 colonies on the resulting plate (Figure 8.1) - how many viable bacterial cells were present in the original culture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Examples of plating and counting colonies from a decimal serial dilution\n\n\n\nHere, we had 173 colonies in 0.1 mL of the dilution present in the 10-4 dilution tube.\nTo calculate the number of cfu/mL present in the original sample, divide the number of colonies on your plate by the total dilution factor: in this case, 173 colonies/(0.1 mL * 10-4) = 1.73 * 107 cfu/mL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTop tips for calculating cfu/mL\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you label your plates with the dilution factor - you will need this for the calculations!\nIdeally, you want to count colonies on a plate that has 30-300 colonies. We normally consider &lt;30 colonies to be Too Few To Count (TFTC) and more than 300 colonies to be Too Numerous To Count (TNTC). You will get more accurate estimates of your viable cell count if you use a countable plate.\nMake sure you use the correct number of significant figures in your answer - you can’t be more precise than your initial measurement (number of colonies counted).\nMake sure you express your answer in scientific notation (e.g., 1.73 * 107 cfu/mL, not 17300000) and include units.\nWhen you’ve finished your calculation, double-check that your answer makes sense! For example, you can’t have a fraction of a colony forming unit - so if your answer looks like 1.73 * 10-7 cfu/mL, you have probably gone awry with your handling of exponents somewhere.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "12.1 Bacterial Mutagenesis - Introduction\nMutagenesis is the process by which the genetic material of an organism is changed, resulting in changes (mutations) from the original (“wild-type”) genetic sequence. In bacteria, mutagenesis is widely used as a tool to generate genetic diversity, study gene function, and create strains with desirable traits (e.g., improved growth characteristics in bioreactors/industrial fermentations, resistance to environmental stresses, or enhanced production of compounds such as antibiotics).\nResearchers often apply mutagenic treatments to large populations of bacterial cells, then screen or select for mutants showing altered phenotypes. Two of the most commonly used methods are UV mutagenesis and chemical mutagenesis, which produce random, untargeted mutations throughout the genome.\nUV mutagenesis exposes bacterial cultures to ultraviolet (UV) light, typically UV-C (around 254 nm), which induces the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA. These lesions can lead to errors during DNA replication, generating mutations.\nChemical mutagenesis uses chemicals that interact with DNA to cause base substitutions, insertions, or deletions. Common agents include alkylating compounds such as ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) or nitrosoguanidine (NTG), which modify DNA bases and increase replication errors. Chemical mutagens can produce a high density of random mutations throughout the genome, creating a broad pool of genetic variants. However, each particular chemical mutagen will have a specific signature (the type of mutation that it causes, based on its chemical structure and mode of action - for example, EMS alkylates guanine residues, resulting in G:C to A:T transition mutations.)\nTransposon (Tn) mutagenesis, by contrast, introduces mutations by inserting a mobile genetic element (transposon) into random sites in the genome. Because the sequence of the transposon is known, the exact location of the mutation can be easily identified afterwards using techniques such as inverse PCR or sequencing across the transposon–genome junction. This makes Tn mutagenesis especially powerful because it can be used to rapidly link genotype to phenotype (whereas UV and chemical mutagenesis often require additional mapping steps to locate the relevant mutation).\nRandom mutagenesis (UV, chemical, or Tn-based) can reveal new genetic variants that would not arise under natural mutation rates or that would not be discovered using targeted (site-directed) mutagenesis approaches, making it a powerful approach for basic research and applied biotechnology.",

If the dose is too high, all of the bacteria in the sample will be killed; however, if it is too low, there will be a large number of unmutated bacteria still present, and it becomes tedious to screen through all of these for the desired phenotype.

In the previous lab, you isolated mutant strains that may produce higher levels of antibiotic.\nIn order to determine whether these strains do, in fact, produce increased amounts of antibiotic, you will examine bioassay data for the wild-type and mutant strains (Section 21.1). Then, you will determine the MIC and MBC for the purified antibiotic against E. coli and compare the efficiency of the antibiotic “X” with other known antibiotics (Section 21.2).\nFinally, you are interested in determining the mechanism of action of this novel antibiotic. To do so, you want to isolate a mutant strain of E. coli that is resistant to the antibiotic “X”. Your final task is to measure the MIC and MBC of the antibiotic for these mutant strain and compare to the data obtained for your wild-type strain (Section 21.3).",

    "text": "18.1 Antibiotic Susceptibility - Introduction\nAntibiotics are compounds that inhibit or kill bacteria, and they act through a range of molecular mechanisms. Major classes target essential cellular processes, including cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, and metabolic pathways. However, the effectiveness of any given antibiotic can vary markedly between bacterial species due to differences in cell envelope structure (e.g. the outer membrane barrier in Gram-negative bacteria), efflux pump systems, target site variants, and the presence or absence of specific resistance genes. Even within a single species, strains may differ in susceptibility due to acquisition of plasmid-borne resistance genes or chromosomal mutations.\nSeveral experimental approaches are used to quantify bacterial susceptibility.\nWhile classical phenotypic assays remain the gold standard, new approaches such as whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and proteomics are increasingly being developed to identify resistance determinants and attempt to predict resistance phenotypes.",

    "text": "The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevents visible growth after incubation, typically determined using liquid (broth) cultures containing different antibiotic concentrations.\nThe minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) goes further to determine the lowest concentration capable of killing the bacteria. After MIC testing, aliquots from non-growing cultures are plated onto antibiotic-free media, and the lowest concentration that kills ≥99.9% of the initial inoculum is recorded as the MBC. While MIC measures growth inhibition, MBC assesses bactericidal activity, so the two values can differ significantly for bacteriostatic versus bactericidal drugs.\nThe Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion assay is a qualitative or semi-quantitative method in which antibiotic-impregnated disks are placed on agar lawns, and the diameter of the growth inhibition zone is measured after incubation. Although disk diffusion does not yield exact concentrations, standardized interpretive breakpoints allow clinicians to categorize isolates as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAntibiotic Susceptibility - caveats\n\n\n\nExperimental conditions can strongly affect the outcome of these assays. Media composition, pH, aeration, and inoculum density can influence antibiotic activity and bacterial physiology, so strict adherence to standardized protocols is essential. Some antibiotics are inactivated by specific media components, while growth conditions (e.g., stationary phase growth) can affect bacterial susceptibility by global physiological and gene expression changes.",

You will be provided with an Hfr donor strain which is streptomycin sensitive and nalidixic acid resistant and which carries the sex factor F integrated into the bacterial chromosome. The Hfr donor strain carries the Tn5 insertion that confers resistance to your novel antibiotic.\nThe Hfr strain is prototrophic and grows on minimal media in the absence of the antibiotic streptomycin.\nThe second strain provided is a recipient strain F- ser- trp- his- cys-, naladixic acid sensitive and streptomycin resistant. The F- strain is auxotrophic and will only grow in the presence of supplements of serine, tryptophan, histidine and cysteine. The F- strain is sensitive to your novel antibiotic.\n When the Hfr and F- strains are mixed together, mating occurs and conjugation tubes are formed between strains (?fig-HfrCross). The presence of the F factor in the Hfr strain mobilises the bacterial chromosome and it is transferred down the conjugation tube into the F- strain. Thus gene transfer occurs in a unidirectional manner. In this practical we will be measuring the transfer of genes for serine, tryptophan, histidine and cysteine requirements, as well as the transfer of the Tn5s. Each individual Hfr strain transfers its genes in a specific orientation and we will be determining this order for the five genes.\nIf the mating mixtures are allowed to remain undisturbed a copy of the Hfr chromosome will eventually be transferred to the F- strain. However, if the mating figures are broken apart by physical agitation then only those genes transferred up to the time of agitation will be transferred to the F- strain. Thus, whether or not a gene has been transferred to the F- provides a measure of the order of transfer by the Hfr. If mating figures are broken at specific times, the frequency of each gene transferred provides a measure of the time of transfer. This is called an “interrupted mating experiment.”",

    "text": "28.1 Experiment 4 - Background\nA fundamental difficulty in biology lies in our ability to link genotype and phenotype: for example, as in this experiment where we will try to link the known phenotype (antibiotic resistance) with the unknown mutation causing the phenotype (location of the Tn5 insertion).\nIn this lab we will be performing a “plasmid rescue” experiment to “rescue” the Tn5 inserted into the chromosome of the mutant strains. This technique uses restriction enzymes that randomly cut chromosomal DNA isolated from the mutant bacteria; this is then ligated into a vector, and E. coli DH5α cells are transformed with this ligation mixture. Transformed cells which carry the region of the chromosome carrying the Tn5 insertion, will be resistant to tetracycline. The plasmid containing this DNA is isolated from the transformants and Sanger sequencing used to identify the exact position of the Tn5 insertion.\nRestriction enzymes are invaluable tools in molecular microbiology. These enzymes make site-specific cuts in DNA (at positions termed restriction sites), and are a key part of the innate immune defences that bacteria use to protect themselves against incoming foreign DNA. Restriction enzymes have found a multitude of applications in molecular biology labs, including their use in cloning, digestion of DNA for Southern blotting, identification of nucleotide differences using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, etc. Being able to carry out a restriction digest of DNA, and analyse the results, is therefore a key skill for any microbiologist or molecular biologist.",

In the previous labs, you isolated resistant E. coli strains and generated a hypothesis about the mechanism of action of the antibiotic.\nIn order to further study the antibiotic mechanism of action, you will use microscopy to determine whether antibiotic X has any effect on an unrelated species (Candida albicans). You will set up cultures with varying concentrations of Antibiotic X and examine the phenotype of antibiotic-treated cells (Protocols 5.1 and 5.2). For comparison’s sake, we have provided you with micrographs of antibiotic X-treated E. coli cells (Chapter 36). You will look at a time course of the response of wild-type E. coli to the antibiotic, and also, will analyse the phenotype of your mutant E. coli strain treated with the antibiotic.",
